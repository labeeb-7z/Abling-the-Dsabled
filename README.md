# Abling-the-Dsabled
There are a tons of organizations out there to help the disabled humans. 
Yet we don't notice a decrease in the difficulties faced by them. Why? Most 
people just don't know about the different assistance available to them.
We solve this problem by providing a single platform - "Abling the Disabled" 
- A Google of help for the differently abled people. You can find all the assistance 
provided by relevant organizations ranging from Mental to Physical disabilities 
and can easily apply for the help!
